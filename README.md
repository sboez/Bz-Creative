Open source website BzCreative, coming soon. 

## Work in progress... :construction:


## Challenge 

:rocket: **Physics :** Three.js doesn't have physic engine but several lib exists, I choose [cannon.js](https://github.com/schteppe/cannon.js) for its simplicity compared to others. Adding physics to a 3D model is tricky.

:package: **Webpack :** I'm not familiary with this yet, config was tedious but finally it works !


## Usage

Install dependencies :
```
npm install
```

Run local server :
```
npm start
```
