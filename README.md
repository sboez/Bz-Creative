## Challenge 

**Physics :** Three.js doesn't have physic engine but several lib exists, I choose [cannon.js](https://github.com/schteppe/cannon.js) for its simplicity compared to others. Adding physics to a 3D model is tricky.


## Usage

Install dependencies :
```
npm install
```

Run local server :
```
npm start
```
