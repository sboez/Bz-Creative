Open source website BzCreative, coming soon. 

## Work in progress... :construction:

## Challenge 

**Physics :** Three.js doesn't have physic engine but several lib exists, I choose [cannon.js](https://github.com/schteppe/cannon.js) for its simplicity compared to others.


## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/sboez/Bz-Creative.git
```

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
